1)There are 4 instances of readLine() in the SOURCE method. 
2)In one of those instances, on line 127, the output from readLine is only used for boolean operation.
3)At other 3 places (Line 109, 144, 214), the output is formatted and set on the member "s" of objects v_mem, v_ext, v_mnt. 
4)Later, these 4 objects are passed to a method publishProgress, which are then accessible in onPregressUpdate() [data passed to publishProgress()
of AsyncTask class is accessible in onProgressUpdate() of AsyncTask]
5)In onProgressUpdate(), the member "s" of verdict object is not accessed at all. 
6)There are no other instances where data from the source, or method "s" is accessed. Thus we mark it as FALSE POSITIVE.
