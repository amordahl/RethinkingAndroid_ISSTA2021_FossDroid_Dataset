1)There are 4 instances of Writer.write() in the SINK method, which take in some parameter. 
    1.1)w.write(String.format(Locale.US, "From: <%s>\r\n", MHT_FROM));
    1.2)w.write(String.format(Locale.US, "Subject: %s\r\n", MHT_SUBJ));
    1.3)w.write(String.format(Locale.US, "Date: %s\r\n", MHT_DATE_FORMAT.format(System.currentTimeMillis())));
    1.4)w.write(String.format(Locale.US, "\tboundary=\"%s\"\r\n\r\n", boundary));
2)The other 4 instances of Writer.write take only constant strings, thus cannot be tainted.
3)Consider (1.1) and (1.2). They take in variables MHT_FROM, MHT_SUBJ, which are constants defined within the class.
  (1.3) also takes in a variable, which is a Date Formatter object. The date formatter takes in the current time in 
  millis, and thus cant be tainted. 

Thus, data doesnt flow from the SOURCE and the flow is classified as FALSE POSITIVE.
