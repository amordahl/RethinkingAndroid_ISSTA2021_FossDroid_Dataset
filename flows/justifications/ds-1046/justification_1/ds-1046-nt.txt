1)The SINK statement is a Log.d() statement. Method init() has 3 instances of Log.d(), however, we are concerned
with the statements which take in a string parameter.
2)We find 2 such Log.d() statements. 
	2.1)In the first statement, the parameter passed is "param_string" which is returned by getFBInfor(...).
	2.2)In the second statement , the parameter is a Matcher.group(...). Matcher.group(...) returns a part of 
	    the string, in param_string variable as follows:
		Pattern p = Pattern.compile(<pattern to match>);
            	Matcher m = p.matcher(param_string);
		Log.d(TAG, "Service: Got pixel format " + m.group(3));
Thus, both these statements take param_string in some format, which is generated by getFbInfo(...).
3)The method getFBInfo(...) is maked as a native function signature.

Thus we mark the flow as NATIVE
