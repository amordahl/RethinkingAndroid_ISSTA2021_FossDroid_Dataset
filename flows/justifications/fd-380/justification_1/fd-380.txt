Application : protect.budgetwatch
Sink:
 DBHelper.java
 Line 68 -- >   _context.sendBroadcast(new Intent(TransactionDatabaseChangedReceiver.ACTION_DATABASE_CHANGED));

Note:
So from sink we can see that it is used as Intent passing and the filter which is listening to this will open after this.
It's not taking any data from source.
So this flow is False Positive.
