1)The SINK invokes the query method on the ContentResolver, and passes 5 parameters to it
2)The 1st one is the ALARMS_URI, which is a constant URI object
3)2nd one is an array of Strings, in which all elements are string constants declared in class AlarmClockProvider.AlarmEntry
4)3rd is the selection criteria, i.e. the column name, declared as a constant string.
5)Last 2 parameters are null.
6)Thus, all parameters are constants, declared in the class AlarmClockProvider. There is no need to backtrack them further.

The flow can thus be classified as FALSE POSITIVE
