1) Our source getContentResolver().query() takes in the following parameters:
	1.1) AlarmClockProvider.ALARMS_URI: a constant string in AlarmClockProvider class
	1.2) a string array, which are projection parameters, with all the elements as constants from AlarmClockProvider class
	1.3) a string, which is a selection criteria, which is again a constant in the AlarmClockProvider class.
all these params cannot be tainted. 
2) The Log.i() statement takes in 2 params => TAG and alarmid
3) TAG is a constant, which is generated within the activity, thus cannot be tainted.
4) alarmid is formed from the intent extra, AlarmNotificationService.ALARM_ID. If the value is not present, alarmid takes the default
value from DbUtil.Settings.DEFAULTS_ID (a constant). Since alarmid comes from an intent extra, source needs to fire an intent, or pass the
cursor object to another class, which in turn, fires an intent for AlarmNotificationActivity.java
5) However, the cursor is only used once in the method (c.get_count()) and is no where passed forward. 

Hence, the flow is classified as FALSE POSITIVE.
