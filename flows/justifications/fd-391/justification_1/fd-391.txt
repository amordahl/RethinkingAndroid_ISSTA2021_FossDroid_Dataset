This is same as fd-390

Application : protect.budgetwatch

Sink:
TransactionViewActivity.java
Line 119 : Log.d(TAG, "Unsupported action '" + action + "', bailing");
action is the only variable in this line of code .

Line 96:  String action = intent.getAction();
Action is getting the Action value passed by intent. eg.ACTION_VIEW.

 Note:
So from sink we can see that it taking values which are constant or are not getting set up anywhere in the code hence null or default value for action variable.
So this flow is False Positive.
