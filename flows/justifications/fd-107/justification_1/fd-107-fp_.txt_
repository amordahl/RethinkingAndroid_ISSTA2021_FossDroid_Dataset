1)The SINK attempts to invoke a startService() method on the Context object.
2)It takes only one parameter, which is an Intent object.
3)The intent takes one parameter, which is the Context object itself, on which the startService() is invoked. 
    3.1)On tracing back, we find that the method maybeShowDismiss() [Which has our SINK statement], was called
        from the onStart() method of AlarmClockActivity(), which passes the Context to it, using "this" keyword, which 
        is a constant.
4)The intent also has an "extra" data, which has key-value pairs as string constants declared within AlarmNotificationService.java

Thus, all the data to the SINK is essentially constant, and thus, the flow is classified as 
FALSE POSITIVE.
