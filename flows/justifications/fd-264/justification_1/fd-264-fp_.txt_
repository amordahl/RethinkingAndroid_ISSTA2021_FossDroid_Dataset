1)The sendBroadcast() method takes an Intent object. There are 7 places from where sendBroadcast() is called from run(). 
2) Out of the 7, 5 calls to sendBroadcast() takes an Intent object, with only an Intent Action. The action is a constant string, and is used only to identify the 
BroadcastReceiver that receives the Broadcast. 
3) The remaining 2 calls contain an Integer Extra, along with the action. This extra integer is defined within the class, and is
used in the Broadcast Receriver only in a switch-case expression.

Thus, the data into the SINK does not come from the SOURCE, and thus the flow is classified as FALSE POSITIVE
