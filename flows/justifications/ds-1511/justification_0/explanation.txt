In the very specific case of 

1. We receive an Intent of the ACTION_DIAL type
2. It contains a phone number
3. We dial that phone number and set it's text to numberField
4. the User presses the btn_call button to call the callNumber() method

This is true when this happens (this is not a flow i can graph
 because in the app we never send an
 ACTION_DIAL type but we can receive them from other apps)

code for step 3:
numberField.setText(number);
DialerActivity.java: Line 369

code for step 4:
case R.id.btn_call: callNumber(numberField.getText().toString()); break;
DialerActivity.java: Line 202
