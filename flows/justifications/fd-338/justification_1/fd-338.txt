SOURCES : there are two sources in this flows from where data can flow

SOURCE =1
Activity: DialerActivity.java
Line:627

Note: the ColumnIndex for getString = 1 and
->value is assigned to phoneNumber

->Phone number is used for conditioned and not passed anywhere so this source is not sending any taints.

----------------------
->SOURCE =2 
Activity: DialerActivity.java
Line:633
Note: the ColumnIndex for getString = 1 and passed through 
method callContantactandFinish()

From the source taint passes to Line 650
->DialerActivity.java
Line:650
Note: value is passed as lookup key in method

Method is defined at this line
DialerActivity.java
Line:968
 public void callContactAndFinish(String lookupKey) {}
Note: method defined here

Next-->
DialerActivity.java
Line:969
Note: lookupkey is passed as condtion for query and not updated anywhere
 startQuery(TOKEN_CALL_CONTACT, null, Phone.CONTENT_URI, null, Phone.LOOKUP_KEY + "=?", new String[] {lookupKey}, null);


----
So both the sources are not passing the taint to any sink then its a false positive.
