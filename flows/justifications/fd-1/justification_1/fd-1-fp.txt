1) 4 params taken by our sink, getContentResolver().update() => URI, ContentValue, String, String[]
2) String and String[] are nulls, so we can ignore those.
3) Lets focus on ContentValues.
	3.1)ContentValue "val" generated inside the method, and we put in 2 keys: AlarmClockProvider.AlarmEntry.ENABLED and
	    AlarmClockProvider.AlarmEntry.NEXT_SNOOZE. Both of them are constants and cannot be tainted. Their values are also constants.
	    so, this variable cannot be tainted.
	3.2)The AlarmClockProvider provides us with the URI, whos parameters are also constants declared within that class. So, it cannot be tainted.
4) No parameter can be traced back to the source and hence, It is a FALSE POSITIVE
