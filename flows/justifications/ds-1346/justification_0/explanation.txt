The sink only gets called when the serviceInfo created on Line 731 of Channel.java is null
this means that the serviceInfo is not apart of the active service list.

the source adds itself to the active service list 
but the sink never interacts with the source because the sink only gets called when a service isn't found

Sink:
Log.w( LOG_TAG, m_name + ": internal error: service not found: " + nsdServiceInfo );
Channel.java: Line 737
