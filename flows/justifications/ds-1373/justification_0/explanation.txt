same explanation as ds-1364.  Sometimes the service doesn't get resolved but the serviceInfo is still all coming from the same place

error code is just the error code the nsdManager handed off to us so it's not taintable

sink:

Log.i(LOG_TAG, m_name + ": onResolveFailed: " + nsdServiceInfo+  "errorCode=" + errorCode);
