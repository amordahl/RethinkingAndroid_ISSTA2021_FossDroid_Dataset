This is same as fd-390

Application : protect.budgetwatch

Sink:
TransactionViewActivity.java
Line 752 :  Log.e(TAG, "Failed to create receipt image: " + resultCode);
Note: resultcode is the only variable in this line of code coming from parameter resultcode.

Line 725:    protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data)

The resultCode is an integer value which comes bydefault in case of successful activity or unsucessful activity.
 Note:
So from sink we can see that it taking values which are constant.
So this flow is False Positive.
