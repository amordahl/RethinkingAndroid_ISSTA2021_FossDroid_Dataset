Other than the Context c, the sink is not passed anything except contexts.
The reasont the Context is not tainted is because android uses contexts to provide resources to activities (therefore, it isn't tainted because it doesn't contain anything)

Sink: c.startService(new Intent(c, AlarmNotificationService.class).putExtra(COMMAND, REFRESH));
