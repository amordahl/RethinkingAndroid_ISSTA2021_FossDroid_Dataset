1)getDeviceIds() returns an integer array of "deviceIds".
2)Each element in deviceIds is iterated over, to make an object of type InputDevice. This object is used in boolean operations,
and the id from the appropriate device is set in lastGamepadId. This id is same as one of the ids, generated by the SOURCE. So, 
lastGamepadId is tainted. 
3)lastGamepadId is used only for a boolean operation in the function and not used anywhere else.
Thus we mark it as FALSE POSITIVE
