1) There are multiple Log.e statements in the sink method, which is in fact a constructor for a class.
2)All the Log.e statements take 2 parameters each. The first one is TAG, which is generated within the file.

within the try-catch block, and is not passed by any other method, there is no need to investigate the data flow further

The flow can be classified as FALSE POSITIVE.
