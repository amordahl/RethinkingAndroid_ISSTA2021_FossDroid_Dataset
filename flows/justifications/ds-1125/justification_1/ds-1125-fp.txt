1)There are 3 instances of invoke() in the SINK method.
2)1st instance takes in a null and a constant "phone", so this cant be tainted.
3)The result of the 1st invoke is passed on to the 2nd invoke(), and its result is in turn passed on to 3rd. 
Thus, no parameters to nvoke come from outside the method, and hence we mark it as FALSE POSITIVE.
