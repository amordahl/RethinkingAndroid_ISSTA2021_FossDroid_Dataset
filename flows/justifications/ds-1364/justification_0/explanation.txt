Lifecycle of serviceInfo is graphed in ds-1345

Basically nsdServiceInfo created on Channel.java: Line 383 which is graphed in ds-1345

Each of these services have a resolveListener assigned to them. 
Once onServiceResolved is called the serviceInfo that was resolved is given to the sink.
 All these are created in the same place

m_name is just a constant

Sink: 
Log.i(LOG_TAG, m_name + ": onServiceResolved: " +nsdServiceInfo);
Channel.java: Line 305
