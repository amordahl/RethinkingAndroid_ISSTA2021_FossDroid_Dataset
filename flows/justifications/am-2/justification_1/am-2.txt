Classification: TRUE POSITIVE

[SOURCE] AlarmNotificationService.java:228 -> the call to getActivity produces a pendingintent, based on the Intent "notify" created on line 219.
AlarmNotificationActivity.java:45 -> alarmid is read in from the intent, which is tainted as it comes from the pending intent.
[SINK] AlarmNotificationActivity.java:47 -> The alarmid is written to a call to Log.i. This is the sink.
