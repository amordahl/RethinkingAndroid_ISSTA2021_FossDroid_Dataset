fd-92
1) The sink tries to start a service.
2) For that, we are making a new intent object, with the intent's destination class, and an intent extra,
with a constant string as the value
3) There is no other parameter being passed to the sink, apart from Context. On tracing backwards, we find that there are 2 places from where 
dismissAllAlarms(Context c) is called
    3.1)AlarmNotificationActivity.java => onComplete() {Line 97}: Context passed using getApplicationContext()
    3.2)AlarmNotificationService.java => class ActiveAlarms => {Line 460}: Context passed in the constructor
        On tracing back from the constructor, we find that the Context is passed to the constructor by using 
        getApplicationContext() {Line 201, AlarmNotificationService.java, method handleTriggerAlarm()}. 
    Since at both the locations, the context is generated within the file, we dont need to trace back.

We can safely classify the flow as FALSE POSITIVE.
