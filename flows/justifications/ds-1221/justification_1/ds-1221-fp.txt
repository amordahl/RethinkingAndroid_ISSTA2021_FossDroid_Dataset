1)There are 5 instances of our SOURCE statement getDataDirectory(). Lets look at each one of them.
    1.1.1)output from getDataDirectory() is fed to Pattern.compile(). This is used to match the variable "line" with the compiled Pattern
    1.1.2)A part of the pattern is accessed at Matcher m.group(1) [Line 216]. This part is from a different part of the pattern, and has nothing to do with the
          output from our source. This can be ignored
    
    1.2.1)output of the SOURCE is applied to the member "s" of the object v_mnt [Line 226]
    
    1.3.1)Same as 1.2.1 [Line 232]
    
    1.4.1)Same as 1.2.1 [Line 239]

    After setting the value of member "s" of v_mnt object, it is passed on to publishProgress(). The variable is later accessed
    in onPublishProgress(). However, in that method, this member "s" is not used. There are no other locations in the app, where data from 
    v_mnt.s is used.

    1.5.1)output of the SOURCE is applied to the member "s" of the object v_deb [Line 308]
    1.5.2)After setting the value of member "s" of v_deb object, it is passed on to publishProgress(). The variable is later accessed
          in onPublishProgress(). However, in that method, this member "s" is not used. There are no other locations in the app, where data from 
          v_mnt.s is used.

Thus, the flow is classified as FALSE POSITIVE
