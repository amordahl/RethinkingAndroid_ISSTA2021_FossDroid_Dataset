Sink:
 DialerActivity.java
 Line 707

  private void clearMissedCalls() {
        // Clear the new missed calls (the actual missed calls, doesn't clear the notification)
    	StringBuilder where = new StringBuilder();
    	where.append(Calls.TYPE);
    	where.append("=");
    	where.append(Calls.MISSED_TYPE);
    	where.append(" AND ");
    	where.append(Calls.NEW);
    	where.append("=1");
    	ContentValues cv = new ContentValues(1);
    	cv.put(Calls.NEW, 0);
    	getContentResolver().update(Calls.CONTENT_URI, cv, where.toString(), null); <----
    }


The sink is getting all the parameter as constant.
URI is constant.
cv contains value zero which is constant
where.toString is a constant also.

So this is False positive as sink is unable to have any taint.
