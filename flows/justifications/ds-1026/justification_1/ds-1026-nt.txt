1)SINK statement setPixels(...) takes in 7 parameters:
	1.1)An int[ ] pixels: This parameter is generated by getFbPixels(...) which is a native function call.
	1.2)Integer constant 0
	1.3)int screen_width: originally written in init() by processing params_string. params_string generated by getFBInfo()
			      which is a native function call.
	1.4)Integer constant 0
	1.5)Integer constant 0
	1.6)int screen_width: same as 1.3
	1.7)int screen_height: originally written in init() by processing params_string. params_string generated by getFBInfo()
			      which is a native function call.
Thus, all parameters to the SINK are either from a native function call or is a integer constant.
Thus we mark it as NATIVE
