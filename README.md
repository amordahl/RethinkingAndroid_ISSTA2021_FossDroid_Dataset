# Structure

The package has two top-level folders.

## Apps

This folder contains the source code for all 30 APKs we selected from Fossdroid. Additionally, the apps_table.png shows the actual names of the apps, along with the version number and lines of code.

## Flows

This folder contains the lists of flows detected, plus the ground truths.

### Flow Lists

The lists of flows are contained in files beginning with all_flows_. These flows are in a modified AQL-Answer format, to which we have added additional information as tags. Notably, the flow tag includes an ID, which is how we reference flows later.

### Ground Truths

Ground truths are included in files called *_groundtruths.xml. These files contain a subset of flows from the corresponding all_flows_*.xml file, but with an additional element, "classification", which encodes the ground truth (either TRUE or FALSE).

### Justifications

The justifications for the classifications can be found in the justifications folder. Each subfolder corresponds to a flow ID, and includes at least two different justifications as generated by our student workers.

We did not mandate a specific way to encode flows, as we thought that giving students the choice on how to do their investigation would strengthen the confidence of their classifications. Among the various formats chosen are graphml files (which can be opened with yEd or other apps), draw.io files (which can be opened with draw.io), or text descriptions.
